\chapter{Future work}
In this chapter ideas for the future of the project are presented.

As the result in section 4.5 reveals to keep a sphere shape is not possible. Because it might be a result of the square lattice it should be tested if the hexagonal lattice type suits this task better. With the hexagonal lattice the cells are hexagons in 2D and rhombic dodecahedrons in 3D. Because rhombic dodecahedron is in its form already similiar to a sphere it might work to keep the sphere shape of a cell with these objects.
