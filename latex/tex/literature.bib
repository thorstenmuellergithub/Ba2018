  Abstract                 = { Although the urinary bladder urothelium has classically been thought of as a passive barrier to ions/solutes, a number of novel properties have been recently attributed to these cells. Studies have revealed that the urothelium is involved in sensory mechanisms (i.e., ability to express a number of sensor molecules or respond to thermal, mechanical, and chemical stimuli) and can release chemical mediators. Localization of afferent nerves next to the urothelium suggests these cells may be targets for transmitters released from bladder nerves or that chemicals released by urothelial cells may alter afferent excitability. Taken together, these and other findings highlighted in this review suggest a sensory function for the urothelium. Elucidation of mechanisms impacting on urothelial function may provide insights into the pathology of bladder dysfunction. },

  Abstract                 = {Using double labeling techniques, we studied the replication of corneal epithelial stem cells that reside exclusively in the limbal zone, and their progeny transit amplifying cells. We show that corneal epithelial stem cells can be induced to enter DNA synthesis by wounding and by TPA. We demonstrate the existence of a hierarchy of TA cells; those of peripheral cornea undergo at least two rounds of DNA synthesis before they become post-mitotic, whereas those of central cornea are capable of only one round of division. However, the cell cycle time of these TA cells can be shortened and the number of times these TA cells can replicate is increased in response to wounding. These results thus demonstrate three strategies of epithelial repair: (i) stem cell replication, (ii) the unleashing of additional rounds of cell proliferation that remain as an untapped reserve under normal circumstances, and (iii) enhancement of TA cell proliferation via a shortening of the cycling time.},

  Abstract                 = {The structure of the urinary bladder of the toad Bufo marinus was studied by light and electron microscopy. The epithelium covering the mucosal surface of the bladder is 3 to 10 microns thick and consists of squamous epithelial cells, goblet cells, and a third class of cells containing many mitochondria and possibly representing goblet cells in early stages of their secretory cycle. This epithelium is supported on a lamina propria 30 to several hundred microns thick and containing collagen fibrils, bundles of smooth muscle fibers, and blood vessels. The serosal surface of the bladder is covered by an incomplete mesothelium. The cytoplasm of the squamous epithelial cells, which greatly outnumber the other types of cells, is organized in a way characteristic of epithelial secretory cells. Mitochondria, smooth and rough surfaced endoplasmic reticulum, a Golgi apparatus, "multivesicular bodies," and isolated particles and vesicles are present. Secretion granules are found immediately under the plasma membranes of the free surfaces of the epithelial cells and are seen to fuse with these membranes and release their contents to contribute to a fibrous surface coating found only on the free mucosal surfaces of the cells. Beneath the plasma membranes on these surfaces is an additional, finely granular component. Lateral and basal plasma membranes are heavily plicated and appear ordinary in fine structure. The cells of the epithelium are tightly held together by a terminal bar apparatus and sealed together, with an intervening space of only 0.02 m{\textmu} near the bladder lumen, in such a way as to prevent water leakage between the cells. It is demonstrated in in vitro experiments that water traversing the bladder wall passes through the cytoplasm of the epithelial cells and that a vesicle transport mechanism is not involved. In vitro experiments also show that the basal (serosal) surfaces of the epithelial cells are freely permeable to water, while the free (mucosal) surfaces are normally relatively impermeable but become permeable when the serosal surface of the bladder is treated with neurohypophyseal hormones. The permeability barrier found at the mucosal surface may be represented, structurally, either by the filamentous layer lying external to the plasma membrane, by the intracellular, granular component found just under the plasma membrane, or by both of these components of the mucosal surface complex. The polarity of the epithelial sheet is emphasized and related to the physiological role of the urinary bladder in amphibian water balance mechanisms.},

  Abstract                 = {We study the interface morphology of a 2D simulation of an avascular tumor composed of identical cells growing in an homogeneous healthy tissue matrix (TM), in order to understand the origin of the morphological changes often observed during real tumor growth. We use the Glazier--Graner--Hogeweg model, which treats tumor cells as extended, deformable objects, to study the effects of two parameters: a dimensionless diffusion-limitation parameter defined as the ratio of the tumor consumption rate to the substrate transport rate, and the tumor-TM surface tension. We model TM as a nondiffusing field, neglecting the TM pressure and haptotactic repulsion acting on a real growing tumor; thus, our model is appropriate for studying tumors with highly motile cells, e.g., gliomas. We show that the diffusion-limitation parameter determines whether the growing tumor develops a smooth (noninvasive) or fingered (invasive) interface, and that the sensitivity of tumor morphology to tumor-TM surface tension increases with the size of the dimensionless diffusion-limitation parameter. For large diffusion-limitation parameters, we find a transition (missed in previous work) between dendritic structures, produced when tumor-TM surface tension is high, and seaweed-like structures, produced when tumor-TM surface tension is low. This observation leads to a direct analogy between the mathematics and dynamics of tumors and those observed in nonbiological directional solidification. Our results are also consistent with the biological observation that hypoxia promotes invasive growth of tumor cells by inducing higher levels of receptors for scatter factors that weaken cell-cell adhesion and increase cell motility. These findings suggest that tumor morphology may have value in predicting the efficiency of antiangiogenic therapy in individual patients.},

  Abstract                 = {Cellular topography within the highly polarized surface epithelia can be used to identify the location of the stem cells. In some instances, this can be quite precise and allows the characteristics of stem cells to be studied. Our current knowledge of the stem cell population in murine epidermis and small intestinal crypts is reviewed. In the epidermis, the stem cells would appear to make up about 10 \% of the basal layer and are distributed towards the centre of the basal layer component of the epidermal proliferative unit. These cells have a long cell cycle and are probably the same cells that retain both tritiated thymidine and radioactively labelled carcinogens for long periods of time. This label retention permits the labelling of the putative stem cell compartment. Over recent years, there has been an accumulation of information indicating various types of heterogeneity within the basal layer, much of which can be interpreted in relation to cellular hierarchies. In the small intestine, cell positions can be fairly precisely identified and the stem cell zone identified. Complex modelling of a wide range of cell kinetic experiments suggests that each crypt contains between 4 and 16 steady state functional stem cells. Radiobiological experiments suggest that up to 32 cells may be capable of clonal regeneration. The repopulation of the clonogenic cell compartment has been determined and the doubling time measured to be 19.7 h. Such studies should throw further light on the behaviour of stem cells and identify the timing of periods of increased and decreased cell proliferation (activation and suppression of controls).},

  Abstract                 = { The uroepithelium sits at the interface between the urinary space and underlying tissues, where it forms a high-resistance barrier to ion, solute, and water flux, as well as pathogens. However, the uroepithelium is not simply a passive barrier; it can modulate the composition of the urine, and it functions as an integral part of a sensory web in which it receives, amplifies, and transmits information about its external milieu to the underlying nervous and muscular systems. This review examines our understanding of uroepithelial regeneration and how specializations of the outermost umbrella cell layer, including tight junctions, surface uroplakins, and dynamic apical membrane exocytosis/endocytosis, contribute to barrier function and how they are co-opted by uropathogenic bacteria to infect the uroepithelium. Furthermore, we discuss the presence and possible functions of aquaporins, urea transporters, and multiple ion channels in the uroepithelium. Finally, we describe potential mechanisms by which the uroepithelium can transmit information about the urinary space to the other tissues in the bladder proper. },

  Abstract                 = {We present a 3D multi-cell simulation of a generic simplification of vascular tumor growth which can be easily extended and adapted to describe more specific vascular tumor types and host tissues. Initially, tumor cells proliferate as they take up the oxygen which the pre-existing vasculature supplies. The tumor grows exponentially. When the oxygen level drops below a threshold, the tumor cells become hypoxic and start secreting pro-angiogenic factors. At this stage, the tumor reaches a maximum diameter characteristic of an avascular tumor spheroid. The endothelial cells in the pre-existing vasculature respond to the pro-angiogenic factors both by chemotaxing towards higher concentrations of pro-angiogenic factors and by forming new blood vessels via angiogenesis. The tumor-induced vasculature increases the growth rate of the resulting vascularized solid tumor compared to an avascular tumor, allowing the tumor to grow beyond the spheroid in these linear-growth phases. First, in the linear-spherical phase of growth, the tumor remains spherical while its volume increases. Second, in the linear-cylindrical phase of growth the tumor elongates into a cylinder. Finally, in the linear-sheet phase of growth, tumor growth accelerates as the tumor changes from cylindrical to paddle-shaped. Substantial periods during which the tumor grows slowly or not at all separate the exponential from the linear-spherical and the linear-spherical from the linear-cylindrical growth phases. In contrast to other simulations in which avascular tumors remain spherical, our simulated avascular tumors form cylinders following the blood vessels, leading to a different distribution of hypoxic cells within the tumor. Our simulations cover time periods which are long enough to produce a range of biologically reasonable complex morphologies, allowing us to study how tumor-induced angiogenesis affects the growth rate, size and morphology of simulated tumors.},

  Abstract                 = { The urinary bladder and associated tract is lined by the urothelium. Once considered as just an impermeable epithelium, it is becoming evident that the urothelium not only functions as a volume-accommodating urinary barrier but has additional roles, including sensory signaling. Lack of access to normal human urothelium has hampered physiological investigation, and although cell culture systems have been developed, there has been a failure to demonstrate that normal human urothelial (NHU) cells grown in vitro retain the capacity to form a functional differentiated urothelium. The aim of this study was to develop a biomimetic human urothelium from NHU cell cultures. Urothelial cells isolated from normal human urothelium and serially propagated as monolayers in serum-free culture were homogeneous and adopted a proliferative, nondifferentiated phenotype. In the presence of serum and physiological concentrations of calcium, these cells could be reproducibly induced to form stratified urothelia consisting of basal, intermediate, and superficial cells, with differential expression of cytokeratins and superficial tight junctions. Functionally, the neotissues showed characteristics of native urothelium, including high transepithelial electrical resistance of >3,000 Ω·cm2, apical membrane-restricted amiloride-sensitive sodium ion channels, basal expression of Na+-K+-ATPase, and low diffusive permeability to urea, water, and dextran. This model represents major progress in developing a biomimetic human urothelial culture model to explore molecular and functional relationships in normal and dysfunctional bladder physiology. },
