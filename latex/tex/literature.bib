  Abstract                 = { Although the urinary bladder urothelium has classically been thought of as a passive barrier to ions/solutes, a number of novel properties have been recently attributed to these cells. Studies have revealed that the urothelium is involved in sensory mechanisms (i.e., ability to express a number of sensor molecules or respond to thermal, mechanical, and chemical stimuli) and can release chemical mediators. Localization of afferent nerves next to the urothelium suggests these cells may be targets for transmitters released from bladder nerves or that chemicals released by urothelial cells may alter afferent excitability. Taken together, these and other findings highlighted in this review suggest a sensory function for the urothelium. Elucidation of mechanisms impacting on urothelial function may provide insights into the pathology of bladder dysfunction. },

  Abstract                 = {Using double labeling techniques, we studied the replication of corneal epithelial stem cells that reside exclusively in the limbal zone, and their progeny transit amplifying cells. We show that corneal epithelial stem cells can be induced to enter DNA synthesis by wounding and by TPA. We demonstrate the existence of a hierarchy of TA cells; those of peripheral cornea undergo at least two rounds of DNA synthesis before they become post-mitotic, whereas those of central cornea are capable of only one round of division. However, the cell cycle time of these TA cells can be shortened and the number of times these TA cells can replicate is increased in response to wounding. These results thus demonstrate three strategies of epithelial repair: (i) stem cell replication, (ii) the unleashing of additional rounds of cell proliferation that remain as an untapped reserve under normal circumstances, and (iii) enhancement of TA cell proliferation via a shortening of the cycling time.},

  Abstract                 = {We study the interface morphology of a 2D simulation of an avascular tumor composed of identical cells growing in an homogeneous healthy tissue matrix (TM), in order to understand the origin of the morphological changes often observed during real tumor growth. We use the Glazier--Graner--Hogeweg model, which treats tumor cells as extended, deformable objects, to study the effects of two parameters: a dimensionless diffusion-limitation parameter defined as the ratio of the tumor consumption rate to the substrate transport rate, and the tumor-TM surface tension. We model TM as a nondiffusing field, neglecting the TM pressure and haptotactic repulsion acting on a real growing tumor; thus, our model is appropriate for studying tumors with highly motile cells, e.g., gliomas. We show that the diffusion-limitation parameter determines whether the growing tumor develops a smooth (noninvasive) or fingered (invasive) interface, and that the sensitivity of tumor morphology to tumor-TM surface tension increases with the size of the dimensionless diffusion-limitation parameter. For large diffusion-limitation parameters, we find a transition (missed in previous work) between dendritic structures, produced when tumor-TM surface tension is high, and seaweed-like structures, produced when tumor-TM surface tension is low. This observation leads to a direct analogy between the mathematics and dynamics of tumors and those observed in nonbiological directional solidification. Our results are also consistent with the biological observation that hypoxia promotes invasive growth of tumor cells by inducing higher levels of receptors for scatter factors that weaken cell-cell adhesion and increase cell motility. These findings suggest that tumor morphology may have value in predicting the efficiency of antiangiogenic therapy in individual patients.},

  Abstract                 = { The uroepithelium sits at the interface between the urinary space and underlying tissues, where it forms a high-resistance barrier to ion, solute, and water flux, as well as pathogens. However, the uroepithelium is not simply a passive barrier; it can modulate the composition of the urine, and it functions as an integral part of a sensory web in which it receives, amplifies, and transmits information about its external milieu to the underlying nervous and muscular systems. This review examines our understanding of uroepithelial regeneration and how specializations of the outermost umbrella cell layer, including tight junctions, surface uroplakins, and dynamic apical membrane exocytosis/endocytosis, contribute to barrier function and how they are co-opted by uropathogenic bacteria to infect the uroepithelium. Furthermore, we discuss the presence and possible functions of aquaporins, urea transporters, and multiple ion channels in the uroepithelium. Finally, we describe potential mechanisms by which the uroepithelium can transmit information about the urinary space to the other tissues in the bladder proper. },

  Abstract                 = { The urinary bladder and associated tract is lined by the urothelium. Once considered as just an impermeable epithelium, it is becoming evident that the urothelium not only functions as a volume-accommodating urinary barrier but has additional roles, including sensory signaling. Lack of access to normal human urothelium has hampered physiological investigation, and although cell culture systems have been developed, there has been a failure to demonstrate that normal human urothelial (NHU) cells grown in vitro retain the capacity to form a functional differentiated urothelium. The aim of this study was to develop a biomimetic human urothelium from NHU cell cultures. Urothelial cells isolated from normal human urothelium and serially propagated as monolayers in serum-free culture were homogeneous and adopted a proliferative, nondifferentiated phenotype. In the presence of serum and physiological concentrations of calcium, these cells could be reproducibly induced to form stratified urothelia consisting of basal, intermediate, and superficial cells, with differential expression of cytokeratins and superficial tight junctions. Functionally, the neotissues showed characteristics of native urothelium, including high transepithelial electrical resistance of >3,000 Ω·cm2, apical membrane-restricted amiloride-sensitive sodium ion channels, basal expression of Na+-K+-ATPase, and low diffusive permeability to urea, water, and dextran. This model represents major progress in developing a biomimetic human urothelial culture model to explore molecular and functional relationships in normal and dysfunctional bladder physiology. },
