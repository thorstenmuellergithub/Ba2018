\chapter{Conclusion}
Final words
\begin{itemize}
\item take a look a biocellion (no race conditions) and morphois
\item use chemical field for growth
\item Random Walker algorithm
\item kugel oberflÃ¤che mit pyramiden berechnen (problem wir haben immernoch pixel und square lattice)
\subitem archimedes volumen eines kugelschnittes
\end{itemize}

\section{Draw Sphere Cells}
It is also possible to use only the effective energy

\section{Calculate Surface Variation Pixels to Sphere}
Two possibilities to design the algorithm
\begin{itemize}
\item check the center of each pixel for the radius, is within the radius or not
\item calculate the y-values of the radius for an x-value of the center of several pixels -> decide dependen on the result of the y-values if the specific pixel is counted or not (if the center of the pixel is within or outside the radius)
\end{itemize}
\section{lambda values}
This was the only way to do it

\section{Approximation \& calculation Errors}
Find a more elegant way to do it. \newline
Floating point arithmetic

\section{CC3D}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{CC3D sucks}
\item 400vx $\cdot$ 400vx $\cdot$ 400vx = 107171875vx CC3D has its problem and crashes sometimes on 4GB RAM
\item CC3D does not empty the used RAM after a simulation -> after several simulations the computer will run out of RAM an CC3D crashes
\item no Debug -> testing with print commands at command line
\end{itemize}
