\chapter{Conclusion}
After this journey the 3D simulation of the urothelium is possible. During this bachelor thesis several important changes at the program and crucial observations were made. \newline
With the modifications of this thesis it might be useful to evaluate the results of the 2D simulation again before the 3D simulation is done in the next step. Then, it is possible to further search for techniques to get a sphere cell within the 3D simulation.

In the end, it is now possible to use the 3D simulation. Together with members at the Clinic of Urology the evaluations of the 2D simulations as well as the results of the 3D simulations should be analyzed. These evaluations of the 2D and 3D simulations can be used to find new patterns and insights on the question how bladder cancer arises.
