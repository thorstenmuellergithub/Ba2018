\chapter{Conclusion}
After this journey the 3D simulation of the urothelium is possible. During this bachelor thesis several important changes in the program and crucial observations were made which substantially improve the simulation of the urothelium. To give the cell a shape like a sphere was not possible, but with the gained knowledge another technique for this problem can be tested. During this thesis several changes were made which influence and improve the simulation program. Therefore, it might be useful to evaluate the results of the 2D simulation again before the 3D simulation is done in the next step. 

To the end, it is now possible to use the 3D simulation. Together with members at the Clinic of Urology the evaluations of the 2D simulations as well as the results of the 3D simulations should be analyzed. These evaluations of the 2D and 3D simulations can be used to find new patterns and insights on the question how bladder cancer arises.
