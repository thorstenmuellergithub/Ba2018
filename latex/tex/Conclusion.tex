\chapter{Conclusion}
After this journey with some ups and downs the 3D simulation of the urothelium is possible. During this bachelor thesis several important changes at the program and crucial observations were made. With these modifications and observations it is now possible to use the 3D simulation in order to receive new insights on the question how bladder cancer arises.
